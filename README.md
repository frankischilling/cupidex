# CupidFM - file editing

CupidFM is a terminal-based file manager implemented in C. It uses the `ncurses` library for the user interface, providing features like directory navigation, directory tree preview, file preview, file editing, and file information display.

### Terminal Requirements

For proper emoji display:
- Make sure your terminal emulator supports Unicode and emoji rendering
For proper emoji and icon display:

1. Install a Nerd Font (recommended):
```bash
# On Ubuntu/Debian:
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/fonts
cd ~/.local/share/fonts
curl -fLO https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.1.1/JetBrainsMono.zip
unzip JetBrainsMono.zip
fc-cache -fv
```

2. Configure your terminal:
- Set your terminal font to "JetBrainsMono Nerd Font" (or another Nerd Font)
- Ensure your terminal emulator supports Unicode and emoji rendering
- Set your locale to support UTF-8: `export LANG=en_US.UTF-8`

Alternative fonts:
- Noto Color Emoji (`sudo apt install fonts-noto-color-emoji`)
- Fira Code Nerd Font
- Hack Nerd Font

If emojis aren't displaying correctly:
1. Check your terminal supports Unicode: `echo -e "\xf0\x9f\x93\x81"`
2. Verify locale settings: `locale`
3. Try updating your terminal emulator to a newer version

Note: Some terminal emulators like Alacritty, iTerm2, Konsole, and Kitty are known to work better with unicode/emojis.

## Prerequisites

To build and run CupidFM, you need the following dependencies installed:

- `gcc` (GNU Compiler Collection)
- `make` (build automation tool)
- `ncurses` library for terminal handling
- `libmagic` for MIME type detection based on file content

### Installing Dependencies on Ubuntu

Run the following command to install the necessary packages:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential libncurses-dev libmagic-dev
```

## Building the Project

To compile the project, run:

```bash
./dev.sh
```

This script will use `make` with predefined flags to compile the source code and produce an executable named `cupidfm`.

### Compilation Flags

The script uses several compilation flags:

- `-Wall -Wextra -pedantic`: Enable warnings
- `-Wshadow -Werror -Wstrict-overflow`: Additional strictness for code
- `-fsanitize=address -fsanitize=undefined`: Enable sanitization for debugging

## Running the Program

After compilation, you can run the program:

```bash
./cupidfm
```

This will start CupidFM. Error logs will be saved in `log.txt`.

## File Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code files
- `dev.sh`: Script for compiling the project
- `Makefile`: Used by `make` for the build process
- `LICENSE`, `README.md`: Documentation and license information

## Usage

- **Navigation**:
  - **Up/Down**: Move between files
  - **Left/Right**: Navigate to parent/child directories
  - **F1**: Exit the application
  - **TAB**: Switch between directory and preview windows
  - **CONTROL+E**: Edit file in preview window
  - **CONTROL+G**: Save file while editing

- **Preview Window**:
  - Up/Down arrows to scroll through file content
  - Supports various file types with syntax-appropriate emoji indicators
